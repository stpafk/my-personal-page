                    Hi! My name is Stephan and I am an aspiring Fullstack Web Developer.
                    My main stack currently is JavaScript (React & Node), but I'm always
                    looking to learn new stuff.
                    My focus in web developing is to deliver an easy-to-use, accessible and
                    maintainable application. Hover by to see some of my knowledges and
                    education!
